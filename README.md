## Notes
My challenges when building the app are:
* Getting used to bootstrap 4 version
* Deadline because I got the announcement last weekend, and have 2 jobs currently. And I can add some more functionalities to it like more Ajax, styling for the page, and so on... if I have more time
* Anyway, I think it is fun ^^
